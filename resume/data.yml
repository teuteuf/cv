about: | 
  Passionate full-stack developer specializing in web application development, Craft practices (TDD, BDD, Clean Architectureâ€¦), and gamification, with nearly 10 years of experience.
  
  My preferred stack is based on TypeScript, primarily using React for the frontend and Node for the backend. I also have experience with Angular and Java backends, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies.
  
  I also enjoy mentoring and training junior developers to help them grow their skills.
